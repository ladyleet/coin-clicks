# Coin-clicks

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.

## What Does This Add-On Do?
* Love Mario and Nintendo? This adds mario coins to your site!
* Yes, you can use this in production. And you should.
* Mario coins pop out of your mouse if someone types in konami code to your site
* Konami code for reference (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a)
* Initializes mario coins for 10 mouse clicks. After 10 clicks, disabled. To re-enable, just use type in the konami code again. :)
